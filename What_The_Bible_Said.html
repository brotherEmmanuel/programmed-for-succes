            I am a believer of the the bible, and my bible tells me that God created the Heavens and the Earth. He also created me and you, dear audience.
            That's is what my bible says. It is easy to mentally accept that yes, i do believe that God created the heavens and the earth. 
            But the testimony of our lives suggests something completely different. yes, it is good to accept with our mouth, <em>yet, believing in the heart, must be the first happening. <bold>The mouth will always spill out what we believe</bold></em>.
