                    This is not an excuse for any failure from us!. Instead, its our proof that we are Victors aswell! Since, when we had chosen to follow Jesus:

                    Jesus defeated Satan because He had

                    This is the very same word which created the devil and demons. Jesus did not look at lying vanities or circumstances around Him!!
                    He walked by Faith even when He was in hell. We mean He walked in the word of God even in Hell. That is why

                    When we had
